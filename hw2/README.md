The description of the hw can be found in the pdf.
This [repo](https://github.com/tech4242/docker-hadoop-hive-parquet) was used to run hadoop with hive.

I tried connecting to the hive server using Hue and beeline (see screenshots). Then, I turned Hue off
since the server kept dying of any non trivial queries. I ran all the queries besides the first one in beeline. The commands and results can be found in the commands file.
